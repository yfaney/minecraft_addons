# üîß Fixes Applied to Chocolate Addon

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Missing Texture ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Chocolate appeared invisible in inventory

**Root Cause**: No texture mapping file to tell Minecraft where to find the chocolate.png file

**Solution**: Created `resource_pack/textures/item_texture.json`
- Maps the texture name "chocolate" to the actual file path
- Required for Bedrock Edition to load custom item textures

### 2. ‚ùå No Speed Effect ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Problem**: Speed boost didn't work when eating chocolate

**Root Cause**: Used event-based command system (`run_command`) which isn't reliable on mobile

**Solution**: Changed to direct food effects system
- Removed event system entirely
- Added effects directly in `minecraft:food` component
- This is the native Minecraft way to apply effects from food
- Works reliably on ALL platforms (iOS, Android, consoles, PC)

## Files Changed

### New File:
```
resource_pack/textures/item_texture.json
```

### Modified File:
```
behavior_pack/items/chocolate.json
```
- Removed: Event system with `run_command`
- Added: Direct `effects` array in food component

## What You Need to Do

1. **Delete old addon** from your device:
   - Settings ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Remove "Chocolate Resources" 
   - Settings ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Remove "Chocolate Behaviors"

2. **Transfer NEW `Chocolate.mcaddon`** to your device
   - Use AirDrop, iCloud, email, etc.

3. **Import and activate** both packs in your world

4. **Test it works**:
   - Get chocolate: `/give @s custom:chocolate`
   - Should see brown chocolate texture ‚úÖ
   - Eat it ‚Üí should get Speed II for 30 seconds ‚úÖ

## Technical Details

**Old System (Didn't Work):**
```json
"events": {
    "on_chocolate_consumed": {
        "run_command": {
            "command": ["effect @s speed 30 1"]
        }
    }
}
```
‚ùå Events/commands unreliable on mobile

**New System (Works):**
```json
"minecraft:food": {
    "effects": [
        {
            "name": "speed",
            "duration": 30,
            "amplifier": 1
        }
    ]
}
```
‚úÖ Native food effect system, works everywhere
